The Adobe engineers actually considered this with the original design
of PDF. Resources, including Fonts and XObjects are usually stored in
the Pages Resources dictionary, but they can be stored further up the
resources tree and inherited by multiple pages. Resources can be
effectively scoped to multiple pages.

I've added support for this in PDF::Content 0.8.8 release. The
following will set up global sharing of resources between pages

use PDF::Lite;
my PDF::Lite $pdf .= new;
$pdf.Pages.global-resources-scope = True;

Any pages you add after this will globally share fonts and
XObjects. They will share the same resources dictionary and have the
same keys for those resources.
