=TITLE GBUMC Name Tags: The Project
=AUTHOR Tom Browder
=DATE 2024-09-17

=head3 Introduction

This paper describes my project to create suitable name tags for use
by GBUMC congregants and staff.

=head3 A. Status as of Sunday, 2024-09-15

I will continue to tweak the name tags, and welcome any suggested
changes. I do plan to make the embellishment pattern (aka GBUMC logo)
exactly the same as the one that appears on the bottom-right corner of
todayâ€™s bulletin. There are also technical issues to fix that unduly
slow the generation of each name tag.

=head3 B. My motivation

In my advanced age, it is getting harder to remember names. Seeing
congregants with an easily-readable name tag helps recalling the name
for use in conversation. My name tag design fits that requirement.

Importantly, it also identifies one as a GBUMC congregant and is very
suitable for wear at any church-related event, particularly public
events such as Trunk or Treat or other outreach events.

=head3 C. Unique features of the name tag

1. If printed correctly on two-sided paper, the same design (and
names) appear even if it is flipped over as happens so often when one
is wearing them.

2. Dimensions, text, colors, and embellishments are easily changed.

3. They are cheap to produce: Clear plastic badge holders from Walmart
(including our local "little" Walmart) or Amazon can be bought for 50
cents or less and they have pocket clips included. Suitable lanyards
are also inexpensive.

4. With the current size of them, eight name tags can printed per
sheet of paper. (I know the church has a good color-capable printer.

5. They are easy to cut out and assemble.

6. Mistakes are readily corrected.

=head3 D. Producing the name tags

I have created a free, publicly available (see details below), Raku
computer language program (see L<https://Raku.org>) that creates the
two-sided PDF sheet for US Letter paper in Portrait orientation. The
program is command-line executed on computers running a GNU/Linux
operating system (I use Debian). It should also run on a MacOS system
when I eventually port the program to it using my wife's Mac (that is
a low priority until users request it by filing an issue on GitHub OR
emailing me).

Note the Mac system will have to have some Rakudo and other
prerequisite programs installed (I have one to work with for my use,
but check with your IT person for any computers on the church's
private network).

It is also possible to port it to Windows, but that is not so easy
given the weirdisms of the Windows OS preventing so many prerequistes
from being ported to it.

=head3 E. Running the name tag program

The only input required is a list of names in a plain text document
such as a CSV file or a Windows Notepad file. That file is provided as
the only input to the program, and the output is a single PDF document
suitable for printing on almost any modern printer, or viewing in most
modern web browsers.

The input file must be formatted according to these rules (see
Formatting notes):

=item one name per line
=item last-name first-name middle-name
=item2 in that order, middle-name is optional

=head4 Formatting notes:

=item names may be separated by spaces or commas
=item2 in a CSV file use the first two or three cells
=item the first-name (along with any middle-name) will be printed on the
first line of the name tag
=item the last-name will be printed on the second line of the name tag

=head3 F. Program code

The program source code is publicly available in the /dev directory of
the FontFactory repository in my GitHub account (see
L<https://github.com/tbrowder/FontFactory>). The program file name is
'make-name-tags.raku'.

=head3 G. Technical notes

=head4 Issues to be corrected:

=item Make the logo image an XOject to improve efficiency
=item Crop the image to eliminate bounding transparent pixels
=item Create hot links for the URL references in this document

=head4 Possible enhancements:

=item Add staff position as a third line
in a smaller font size

=head3 Summary

The project provides a turn-key solution to an inexpensive way to
provide name tags if desired. It has been fun to do and it has added
to my knowledge (and that of my Raku PDF mentor) of PDF graphics
handling and clipping.

I am happy to assist in producing or helping with any part of using
the name tags. I can also easily produce the PDF documents at home if
I receive the input files, and then email them back to the requestor.

I am available to answer questions or provide other help in person or
by email (tom.browder@gmail.com) or mobile phone (850-830-8078).  (I
normally don't answer unless I recognize the number, but will return
your call if you leave a voice message.)
